            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Add vnto this, that (hauing long knowne you) I could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer finde other minde in you then that which was of the ſide and part of goodneſſe, oppoſing euill and the workers thereof. Much elſe might bee ſpoken of you particularly and truly to the praiſe of God; but He that ſeeth in ſecret will reward you openly. This, at this time, made me bold with <hi>your Name,</hi> which is as an ointment of ſweet odour in the Countrie you liue in. And ſo I make humble tender of a mean Commentarie vpon a Pſalme of grace: the Pſalme was Dauids; the Speakers, God and Dauid. God ſpake to Dauid with good words and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable, as <hi>Zacharie 1.13.</hi> and the ſame Almighty God in the ſame moſt gracious Pſalme, ſpeakes with like comfort to you, and to all his by Him. <hi>Reuerend Beza</hi> in his argument vpon it, tells what comfort the had by it, when hee (firſt) heard it ſung in an aſſemblie of Chriſtians. <hi>It ſo carried him by diuine rape at that inſtant, that euer (after) he laid it vp gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen in his heart:</hi> for, as if it had lift him vp, from the earth, into heauen, it rauiſhed all his powers, <hi>making him to thinke hee heard God himſelfe to call vnto him by particular. name:</hi> what that Worthy conceiued by the ſinging of the Pſalme, that may your worthy ſelfe gather by the meditation. <hi>The Shield of it is large enough to compaſſe you</hi> (alſo) <hi>with the like mercie.</hi> If you put on the defence of the Higheſt; this Pſalme will guide your wayes to peace, and finiſh your courſe with much true comfort. Thinke therefore (Chriſtian Sir) in reading of this Pſalme what <hi>godly Beza</hi> conceiued
<pb facs="tcp:4442:3"/>vpon the ſinging of it: and that is, <hi>that God calleth you by Name,</hi> meaning to inueſt <hi>you</hi> in theſe priuiledges of his Saints, and to be <hi>on your right hand</hi> euer: wherefore, what is here ſpoken to the Saints, reade with faith, as ſpoken to your ſelfe, being <hi>a Saint by calling:</hi> with this meditation you may make <hi>your pillow, when you ſhall bee ready to make your bed in the darke, and the graue ſhall bee your houſe, Iob. 17.13.</hi> Then ſhall you goe with much contentment <hi>to your bed of earth, and in great peace to the Lord.</hi> Meane while, turne your purer eyes into this excellens Pſalme, ſet foot into it, rather walke through it in your deeper conſideration: and then confeſſe, with gladneſſe, <hi>what God hath done for your ſoule.</hi> May you not ſay that God hath been, or will bee (ſhortly) all that vnto you that the Pſalme (ſo comfortable) ſpeaketh of? for, hath not God beene, in all remoues, your ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding houſe to remooue vnto? <hi>verſe 1.</hi> hath hee not beene your hope from your youth, nay from your cradle? and haue you truſted in him, at any time, in vaine? <hi>verſe 2.</hi> haue not the feete of many beene taken in the <hi>Snare</hi> or <hi>Net</hi> of <hi>Peſtilence,</hi> and you deliuered? <hi>verſe 3.</hi> haue not thouſands fallen and you ſtood? <hi>verſe 7.</hi> and haue you not ſeene your hope, when there was nothing but deſtruction to ſinners? <hi>verſe 8, 9.</hi> haue not the Angels kept the Lords watch about you in your continuall ſafety to this day? <hi>verſe 11, 12.</hi> Is not the Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon of hell, and that roaring Lion of the nethermoſt hell put vnder your feet for euer? <hi>verſe 13.</hi> In many troubles, haue not you beene quit, and not quit onely, but raiſed to place and worſhip? <hi>verſe 14, 15.</hi> and, for length of dayes (though not full of daies, for I truſt there are many behinde) you are not farre from Dauids yeeres of ſeuenty? <hi>verſe 16.</hi> in which ſpace of time, I doubt not but you make your ſhort life a ſhort draught of the dayes euerlaſting: Finaly God hath ſhewed you his large ſaluation.

In ſuch caſes, God in the Old Teſtament, bids vs call vpon him, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 50.15. and Chriſt, in the New, doth call vs to him, <hi>Mat.</hi> 11.28. therefore, in the day of affliction, we muſt haue our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort from God, and our eaſe in Chriſt. <hi>Eliphaz</hi> telleth <hi>Iob,</hi> that if he will returne to the Almighty; that is, caſt himſelfe wholy vpon him for his helpe in affliction, and make him his confidence by faith in his truth; he ſhall be builded vp, to wit, in as good an eſtate as euer he had, <hi>Iob</hi> 22, 23. as if he had ſaid; he that pulled thee downe in this abiect condition, will ſet thee vp againe (as a glorious building) in a more excellent plight, if thou reſigne all, thy ſelfe, and (all) to him. <hi>Aſa</hi> did ſo: for, he reſted on God, being to fight againſt a million of men that came ſtrong againſt him: the Text ſaith, <hi>that hee cried to the Lord his God, and went out in that name onely againſt that great multitude,</hi> 2 Chron. 14.11. he was able to number in his own Army a great many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands; as of thoſe, who, in the Army of <hi>Iudah,</hi> bare ſhields and ſpeares, three hundred thouſand; and of thoſe who in <hi>Beniamin,</hi>

In this confidence, going forth againſt ſo huge an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my and great Hoaſt, he ſo preuailed (the Lord looking on) verſe 13. that he carried away both the liues and ſpoile of all that mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, verſe 13, 14.</p>
               <p>So that woman of great faith, after ſhee had paſſed through the pikes to Chriſt, receiued both the commendation of her great faith, and health of her poſſeſſed daughter, <hi>Mat.</hi> 15.28. <hi>Dauid</hi> in many Pſalmes, profeſſeth that hee ſought the Lord, to wit, in trouble, and found him; that is, found helpe in him, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 34.4.17. <hi>&amp; Pſal.</hi> 3.4. <hi>&amp;</hi> 6 8, 9. it was familiar to him to ſay; <hi>helpe Lord, for vaine is the helpe of Man, Pſal.</hi> 60.11, the Centurion came to Chriſt for his ſeruant, <hi>Mat.</hi> 8.5, 6. and the Ruler beſought Chriſt for his daughter, <hi>Luke</hi> 8.41, 42.

The <hi>meanes</hi> are to meditate daily; that is, much in the Word; laying vp knowledge in our hearts, the knowledge of the truth and of God, that we may be inſtructed in his promiſes, and perſwaded of his power, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 1.1, 2. for, this knowledge, well digeſted, will ſtay vs in the wauerings of many; when by the light of it, we ſhall ſee him that is inuiſible, and his power that is Almighty: able to helpe vs when wee haue the whole world and all the elements againſt vs, and without whoſe helpe, all helps in the world can doe nothing for vs. Another <hi>meane</hi> is, well to obſerue his prouidence to which all ſecond cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes doe ſeruice; and the experience of Gods children who, putting truſt in God, were euer deliuered in due time. Another is, to affect God aboue all things: for, then we will truſt him before all men, it being certaine, that what we moſt affect, wee moſt leane vnto; as if it be profit, we depend vpon it; and if pleaſure, we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre all to it. And another is, to conſider that it caſteth an impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation vpon God to call him Father, and not to beleeue that hee will doe a fathers part in prouiding for vs: for, can naturall chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren depend (altogether) vpon their fathers care for their wealth and finding; and ſhall Gods children diſtruſt a more able and mercifull father that hath vndertaken to keepe them, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed, when father and mother ſhall forſake them, to take them vp? God hauing (then) promiſed to be our God; will wee bee Gods to our ſelues, liue at our owne finding, and giue the Lord
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:4442:6"/>little or no credit for his care of looking to vs? and what doe we better or other, when by making ſhift for our ſelues beyond and againſt the rules of his word &amp; prouidence, we take the care of vs wholly from him, and put it in our own hands &amp; keeping? There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to get confidence in God, the way is ſo to vſe the means and helps of our preſent life, that we forget not, that they are <hi>giuen</hi> to vs by God, and become good for vs by his <hi>bleſſing:</hi> for, (then) wee will not truſt in them, but put truſt in him that gaue them; when we <hi>haue</hi> them we will not depend vpon them, and when we <hi>want</hi> them, we will beleeue without them. Theſe are the means, and this is the way to make <hi>God our ſecret place;</hi> but who vſeth theſe meanes, and obſerueth this way of comming to him? who careth to know by the word, either his promiſe, or truth to his children, to make him faithfull? Surely, if we regarded this duty, and the benefit it bringeth, where it is rightly done; in a time of ſcarcitie, wee would not be ſo diſtruſtfull, nor feare ſo immode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately when any <hi>Peſtilence</hi> commeth: In our <hi>neceſſitie</hi> wee would not deale vniuſtly nor ſteale; nor when <hi>ſickneſſe</hi> takes vs, fare as if death were preſented to vs. When we looſe a commoditie, we would not looſe God (as many do) for the hauing of it againe from the diuell in a Coniurer: nor, if a tooth ake, go from God to a charmer for the eaſe of it, in ſome helliſh myſterie: nor if a croſſe come, iuggle it away with mirth; and ſo turne out God, when wee ſhould turne to God: but with <hi>Iob; if God ſhould kill vs, we would trust in him, and reproue our waies in his ſight.</hi> Iob. 13.15.</p>
               <p>But that which is (heere) tranſlated <hi>[dwelleth]</hi> is as much in weight, as ſitteth, or is ſetled; and ſo, our dwelling in Gods ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret, is as much as our ſitting downe in it: the meaning is, wee muſt make it our reſt, as if we ſhould ſay; <hi>Here will we dwell.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>From whence we learne, that Gods children ſhould not come <label type="milestone">

               <p>The <hi>reaſons:</hi> The Text here ſayth, <hi>He is Almighty,</hi> and our Creed calls him, <hi>the Father Almightie,</hi> that is, the al-ſufficient God that can as ſoone make rich, as ſuddenly poore; and can as eaſily make ſomething out of nothing, as he can preſently bring much or all, to nothing: for, as one ſayth, <hi>Eius eſt nihilum, cuius eſt totum.</hi> Nothing is matter for his power, as much and as well as all are, that haue being. We ſee this in the ſudden change of things: and (firſt) of Eſtates. For, rich <hi>Iob,</hi> how quickly, and in how few dayes, nay houres, was he made poore <hi>Iob;</hi> after God had blown vpon his eſtate with his wind of taking all away? <hi>Iob.</hi> 1.1, 2, 21, 22. And as this is true in the change of eſtates, ſo it is in all other changes by <hi>Peſtilence,</hi> by <hi>ſickneſſe,</hi> and other roddes of God, where all meanes worke by his power, and doe his will that moueth in them. For, for the fearefull peſtilence, and burning coales therof ſent from between his feet: Whoſe command is ouer it, when it rageth in one Countrie, and is not heard to crie in another? nay, who ruleth it, and moueth in it, when, being in the ſame towne or citie, it is in one ſtreete, and in one houſe, and not in another? Being in the ſame houſe, how commeth it to paſſe, that it faſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth vpon three, or two or one, and not vpon all, ſeeing all eate and drinke together, liue in the ſame common aire, and lodge in the ſame chamber, ſometimes in the ſame bed? Is not this (alſo) the worke of God?</p>
               <p>And doth not God (ſometimes) in the cure of a diſeaſe (which hath no great hardneſſe) ſo diſtemper and confound the wiſeſt Phyſitions iudgement that he ſhall not be able rightly to diſcerne the nature and proper cauſes of it? when hee hath found them; may he not faile in miniſtring or preſcribing to them? or, if he do this well; may not the remedie come too late, and when the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient

Secondly, if his bleſſing beare the whole ſway (as it doth) both in want and fulneſſe; if that make rich both in pouertie and abundance, and that onely, as it onely doth; and if that be giuen to thoſe that reſt on Gods prouiſion in their low ebbe, and denied to thoſe that depend vpon themſelues in a fuller tide of things: how can but it be neceſſary to all that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>true riches and a bleſſed increaſe, to waite vpon Gods hand with a continuall eye, without diſtruſt of his prouidence, who onely is able to bleſſe with meanes, and hath power to bleſſe without them?

In this Verſe, hauing in his owne perſon found the Lord his ſpeciall Protector, he ſpeaketh thankfully of the ſame, the rather to eſtabliſh others, by his experience, in the like <hi>ſaluation of God:</hi> as if he had ſayd; as I haue beleeued and found, ſo I will ſpeake in my heart before God, and with lippes before men, <hi>Rom,</hi> 10.10. <hi>The Lord is my refuge, and</hi> ſhall be <hi>my fortreſſe, in whom I</hi> will <hi>truſt,</hi> to whom I will flye in all my trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles. The word that is here tranſlated, <hi>his ſuccour,</hi> or <hi>place of ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,</hi> ſignifieth a couer, or <hi>place of defence</hi> in ſome great <hi>tempeſt:</hi> where his meaning is, that when hee was wet, or like to be wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed with great ſhowres of trouble at hand, or in doing, he retired himſelfe to the Lord in his prouidence, againſt all that tyrannous and ſtormy tempeſt of his cruell perſecution. <hi>Iob.</hi> 24.8. <hi>Eſa.</hi> 25.4. By <hi>fortreſſe,</hi> the Prophet vnderſtandeth a place of retire, or ſome ſtrong fort in warres. As if he had ſayd, as it was ſayd of <hi>Ioſeph, Gen.</hi> 49.23. <hi>When the Archers grieued him, and ſhot againſt him, the Lord being his Tower and ſtrong Caſtle; his bowe abode ſtrong, and the hands of his armes were ſtrengthened by the hands of the mightie God of Iacob, ver.</hi> 24.

               <p>And (here) the Prophers example may teach the Prophets <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Doct. </seg>1</label> themſelues; that the beſt way to turne ſoules to God, is to teach them by their owne experience, faith and feeling; the beſt tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers of others are men of experience, and they are likeſt to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uert
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:4442:12"/>others, that firſt haue bene conuerted themſelues. So <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51.12.13. the Prophet firſt prayeth the Lord to teach him, and then promiſeth to the Lord to teach others, being firſt taught of him: and he aſſumeth, when God ſhall ſtabliſh him with his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, in the receit of that fauour by a teaching ſpirit to turne others to God. The Apoſtle Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> ſpeaking of himſelfe and his o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther fellow Apoſtles, ſaith; that <hi>they are (firſt) comforted of God, that they might be able (in God) to comfort others in euery affliction.</hi> 2. Cor. 1.4. as if he had ſaid; till God had filled their pits they could not be ſpouts to others, and when their ciſterns were full, their conduits would go; and ſo they would teach others the comforts that they had learned themſelues. Chriſt biddeth, <hi>Peter</hi> being conuerted himſelfe, (not before he was conuerted him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe (to ſtrengthen his brethren. Luke 22.23. and he that (firſt) had learned the feare of God, ſaith: <hi>Come children, hearken vnto me, I will teach you the feare of the Lord.</hi> Pſal. 34.12. So it is plaine, that the beſt conuerters of others are men of experience, men that haue bene firſt conuerted themſelues. <hi>Pauls</hi> experience and doctrine put together, wrought mightily to the edification of the bodie of Chriſt. For, as he that hath bene ſicke, and cured of an infirmitie, being wiſe and tender hearted, can better direct, and will ſooner helpe another to auoyd it; or being viſited with it, to recouer of it, then he that neuer knew the remedie of ſuch a ſickneſſe, nor eurer had occaſion of the cure: ſo they that haue bene cured of ſinne themſelues, and haue felt the twitches of a ſorrowfull heart, wounded therewith and eaſed thereof, are bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter able to preuent ſinne in others, or, being in force, to weaken it with teaching, then they who liue ſtill in their ſinnes without all experience, or deſire of ſuch a cure.

So, where by <hi>Hoſea</hi> the Lord ſaith <hi>I am God and not man: Hoſea</hi> 11.9. what can his meaning be, but that, being God, hee changeth not like one of vs, and repenteth not like man?

<pb n="58" facs="tcp:4442:33"/>deſtroyeth without mercie, <hi>in darkeneſſe, and at noone day?</hi> To this the Prophet maketh anſwer, ſaying: Though thouſands, that is, great numbers, and ten thouſands, that is, numbers without num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber ſo fall, being cut downe with it, or other diuers diſeaſes, and ſundry kinds of death, on the left hand and on the right of his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants, yet he can deliuer them. For, with him it is no more to ſaue his people when thouſands die then when two; and when tenne thouſands periſh, then when ten (onely) are cut downe for the graue. In a time of <hi>Peſtilence;</hi> he is able to paſſe by the houſes of the faithfull as well when a whole towne is viſited, that is, when no ſtreete or lane is free, as when a few houſes are ſhut vp: and as well, if three hundred ſhould die in a weeke, as if onely three.

               <p>An admonition to Gods faithfull Miniſters; the louder God <label type="milestone">

<pb n="64" facs="tcp:4442:36"/>Gods doings, and to vſe the eyes that he hath giuen them, <hi>to ſee his workes,</hi> and <hi>not to behold vanitie.</hi> It hath beene ſaid of the righteous, <hi>that they ſee the Plague,</hi> that is, as they thankfully ſcore vp bleſſings when they come, ſo they dolefully record the curſe when it commeth, <hi>Prou.</hi> 22.3. Neither do they ſee it onely, but hide themſelues from it in a pure heart, and innocent life: where the wicked, not fearing the ſhot of God, neither the artillerie of his iudgements, go on ſtill, to wit, after one faſhion, and in their old way of impenitencie and hardneſſe, till they be deſtroyed. Good men will deepely imprint Gods doings; and be ſure to haue an arke of prouidence, builded by repentance, to flee vnto when a floud is ſent: the wicked (hauing no ſuch conſideration) ſtand naked by ſinne in the face of euery ſtorme that is ſent, and periſh in it. The ſumme of all is this: they that be Chriſtians in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, muſt and will take a true inuentorie of Gods fauours and iudgements, and ſet downe in their minds by deepe obſeruation, as with a pen of iron, what he hath ſtrangely done, where Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians in face onely haue no ſuch notes about them of his ſtrange acts, and forget all his workes, as if they had neuer bene. Let vs (therefore) not forget Gods acts, his ſtrange acts: neither Gods workes, his fearefull workes, worthy to be had in remembrance. And put it in your bookes what he did ſo lately; one yeare in a ſpring of no raine, and the next yeare in a ſommer of ſo much raine: take your bill, or booke of tables, and write what God did ſcarefully in that great <hi>Plague,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Luke 16.6.7.</note> and ſtrangely in remouing it. Alſo, what deſolations he made by the ſea, in thoſe Weſt-country flouds: or, if we haue forgotten, let vs remember how God ſet his heauen as braſſe againſt our faces of braſſe: and made it to weepe day and night in raine of long continuance, becauſe wee would ſhed no teares for our ſinnes. Let vs not forget the ſignes which he ſent among vs, and which haue not bene few: nor his tokens on earth, nor his wonders in the ſea: nor what ſtrange lights he hath ſet with his owne hand in the firmament: nor what a graue was made for vs by Spaniards once, and once by men of our owne nation; and how we were (at both times) deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered, and they throwne in as our ranſome: nor how often the ſword hath bene ſet to our very heart, in practiſes againſt our mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in <hi>Iſrael</hi> and our father now.</p>

               <p>Gods end in cauſing the righteous to ſee the <hi>Plagues</hi> of ſinners, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> is to aſſure them (the more) in their weake faith and patience, that he will ratifie what he hath ſpoken: and here we learne, That the <hi>Lord knowing whereof we are made, Pſal.</hi> 103.14. doth diſpenſe with his owne right, to beare with our infirmities. So he did not onely burie the <hi>Aegyptians</hi> in the ſea, but did it, his people loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king on, <hi>Exod.</hi> 14.30.31. who ſaw them to go downe (quicke) to thoſe graues: and <hi>Dauid</hi> ſaith, <hi>When the wicked ſhall periſh, thou ſhalt ſee<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Pſal.</hi> 37.34. His meaning is, that the wicked ſhall die ſtrangely, and that the godly ſhall ſee their ſtrange death: they ſhall periſh as God hath ſaid, and the other ſee it, that they may not doubt: or, they ſhall periſh that God may magnifie his truth vpon his enemies, and his people ſee it, that he may be magnified in his children. <hi>The ſmoke of Sodome mounted vp as the ſmoke of a fornace,</hi> and <hi>Abraham muſt ſee it, Geneſ.</hi> 19.28. <hi>Sedome</hi> was wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked and deſtroyed, and <hi>Abraham</hi> the friend of God beheld her deſtruction.

For, the man of power ſhall be deſtroyed, and the man of wiſedome, <hi>the righteous man ſhall ſee it, Pſal.</hi> 52.5.6. The reaſons:</p>
               <p>Our graces of faith, patience, perſeuerance, ſpirituall fortitude, <label type="milestone">

And now, as there is no ſenſe more helpefull and certaine then this of ſeeing, none that imprinteth deeper affections in the <hi>paſſiue</hi> part of the ſoule, then it: So the Lord chuſeth in ſuch caſes, to confirme and ſettle vs, rather by ſeeing then by heare-ſay. He that is able to ſay, that he is an eye-witneſſe to a thing, may better reſolue himſelfe and perſwade another in that thing, then he that can onely ſay, he heard it.</p>
               <p>Secondly, if God did not thus to beare with his children, by <label type="milestone">

Now, the Lord knowing that ſuch frights are ſometimes neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie for his children to the helpe of their conuerſion to him, doth ſet the wicked before them in the recompence of their errour by ſome notable deſtruction, that they may take heede in time.</p>

If God be terrible in his works; that is, if he viſit with a wonderfull <hi>Plague,</hi> with ſtrange ſickneſſes and yeares, with diſorderly ſprings and ſummers, with dearths and death, it is that the world, the godly (at leaſt) ſhould worſhip him, <hi>and ſing vnto his Name, Pſal.</hi> 66.3, 4. or, that they ſhould turne to him, and not turne wantons. For, they are not ſpared by chance, or becauſe they are worthy: nor doe they ouerliue the calamities of thoſe; who in times of mortalitie, come ſooner to deaths houſe then they, that they ſhould flatter themſelues in an euill cuſtome, becauſe God hath beene more fauourable to them then to theſe: but they ſee the deſtruction of others, in their owne ſafetie, that by ſuch a ſight they may be made more fearefull to offend, and more carefull to pleaſe God in his commandements now, then before. And this good vſe muſt all Gods children make of his ſparing hand to them or theirs, not carrying the grace of it into wantonneſſe: for, God doth it in loue to their benefit, and they muſt apply it in wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome to the cure of their vnbeliefe and purging of their wickedneſſe. Some, (as if the Lord did puniſh at aduenture in ſuch caſes, and not directly for ſinne) hold on their prouocations, neither changing their <hi>skinne,</hi> nor altering their <hi>ſpots, Ier.</hi> 13.23. And theſe are more ſenſles then the ſenſles beaſt: for, the Beaſt feareth exceedingly when hee ſeeth one of his fellowes knockt
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:4442:37"/>downe before his face, and pitifully roareth out when he ſenteth his fellowes blood: but theſe are ſenſles of Gods ſtrokes lift vp vpon men like themſelues: and are not moued where the beaſt is ſo greatly moued: neither pitie Chriſtian blood. It is ſaid of the waters, that they ſaw God, and <hi>were afraid, Pſal.</hi> 77.16 and of the earth, that it beheld his lightnings, <hi>and ſhooke, verſe</hi> 18. theſe ſee him in his iudgements, and feare nothing: and (in times of <hi>Plague</hi>) behold him in many deaths, which are lightnings be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore their owne death, and ſhake neuer a whit. But Gods chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, being taught in a better ſchoole, muſt make another and a better vſe of his patience towards them, and iudgements in the world; not imputing their ſafetie to chance, or proudly to their worthineſſe, as if they had beene no ſuch ſinners as they vpon whom the tower of thoſe deaths fell, &amp; ſlew them <hi>Luk.</hi> 13.4. but aſcribing all to God that ſpared them, and confeſſing before him, and the ſonnes of men, how iuſtly he might haue donne as much, or more to them, but that hee would haue them to liue to praiſe his name, and to confeſſe his truth, that had made them to follow others to their graues, who might haue followed them to theirs.</p>
               <p>Secondly, this example of Gods bearing with vs, ſhould be an <label type="milestone">

And (here) ſpirituall men ſhould remember that they were once carnall: and old men not forget that once they were children: they that haue paſſed the temptations of youth, ſhould call to minde what difficulties they mett with in the paſſage: and they that haue gotten the ſhoare, think of the ſea which they haue eſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped: for, thus beholding others in the glaſſe of themſelues, (not as they are but as they haue beene) they ſhall bee better able to ſhew this meekneſſe to all men; becauſe they themſelues were <label type="milestone">

How can

And <hi>God be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginneth his anger</hi> (ſometimes) <hi>at his owne houſe,</hi> and <hi>viſiteth</hi> firſt there: but there is great difference betweene the righteous and the wicked in theſe viſitations, whether we reſpect the cauſe, ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects, or end of this hand of God vpon them. For, <hi>in loue he layeth his rod vpon the righteous,</hi> which he doth not when he breaketh the wicked and ſinners with his iron rod. Alſo, the tribulations of the godly <hi>bring forth patience,</hi> which <hi>patience</hi> begetteth <hi>experience,</hi> and <hi>experience</hi> the <hi>hope that maketh not aſhamed, Rom.</hi> 5.3.4.5. but no ſuch things are to be ſeene in the tiring <hi>Plagues</hi> of the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly, and for the end of God in this matter, there is great diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to be put betweene the viſitation of Sion to humble his children; and the deſtruction of <hi>Sodom</hi> to plague his enemies. A father may correct his child and ſeruant with one rod, and after one manner: yet he loueth his child as his child, and his ſeruant as is fit; or, he loues him as his child, though he chaſten him as his
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:4442:41"/>ſeruant. So in a common viſitation by <hi>Plague,</hi> famine, ſtrange diſeaſes and deaths, the Lord may and doth ſtrike with the ſame rod of common viſitation both his children and enemies, yet his children hee correcteth in great loue and for their great good, but conſumeth the ſinners, and where are they? and he ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth away his children, but not as <hi>he cutteth off the wicked in the continuance of his anger, Ierem.</hi> 15.15. His children he whipeth ſometimes with death, becauſe by ſome vnpurged euill they haue prouoked him; the other he puniſheth with euerlaſting death, that he may be auenged of his enemies, &amp; eaſed of them that hate him. It is our dutie (therefore) when God begins any publicke viſitation to ſubmit preſently, and preſently by repentance to purge for the diſeaſe that cauſeth it: that is, for ſinne that aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth.

               <p>THe promiſe made to the righteous of deliuerance in all their dangers and feares, is here repeated. For, by euill the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet meaneth (though more ſpecially the euill of <hi>Peſtilence</hi>) yet (generally) any other euill of ſmart, cauſed by the euill of ſome. And (ſaith he) this ſhall not befall either the <hi>perſon</hi> or <hi>habitation</hi> of the righteous. His meaning is, (which muſt be vnderſtood,) that God will ſo direct their heart, and guide their way, that they ſhall not ſtubbornly or maliciouſly prouoke him to plague them, as do the vngodly. Now where there is no euill of ſinne (ſo) com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted: how can any euill of puniſhment come, or come to hurt them, that ſo vnwillingly offend; puniſhments being ordained for wilfull ſinners, and euils for them that euill do? This I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaue to be the Prophets meaning in theſe words; wherein a gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious promiſe is renewed, firſt to the godly mans <hi>perſon:</hi> and (then) to his <hi>houſe</hi> or Tabernacle. To his <hi>perſon</hi> God promiſeth by his Prophet, that <hi>no euill ſhall befall it,</hi> that is, (as hath beene
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:4442:41"/>ſaid) he ſhall ſo order his heart, and direct his wayes by the grace that is giuen him, and ſo auoyd the cauſe of euill with the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, that he ſhall not runne vpon the ſharpe of thoſe plagues, that (ſo commonly) runne the vngodly through to deſtruction; but he muſt (then) auoide the occaſion, and take away the cauſe. From whence we learne:</p>
               <p>That to auoyd plagues, the way is to auoyd thoſe offences, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Doct. </seg>
                  </label> with the occaſions that bring them. And therefore <hi>Salomon</hi> telling the fooliſh and ſcornefull, why they lay vnder ſo many plagues, and Gods ſtorme was ſo vpon them, giueth this reaſon: <hi>they tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned not at his reproofe, Prou</hi> 1.23. that is, they were plagued be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they ſinned: or, euill befell them, becauſe euill was in them. <hi>If ye conſent and obey</hi> (ſaith the Lord by <hi>Eſay</hi> to his people) <hi>ye ſhall eate the good things of the land, Eſay,</hi> 1.19. that is, in your obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, good ſhall come and not euill: or locke for good and not euill: for there ſhall be none, where ye giue occaſion of none. And the Prophet <hi>Zephanie</hi> exhorting the people to repentance, biddeth them <hi>to ſearch themſelues before God make inquiſition: Ze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanie</hi> 2.1. or to driue away the chaffe of occaſion, before his wind or fanne come, which will purge them with iudgment, becauſe they haue not purged by repentance. For this (ſaith the Prophet) <hi>ye muſt do before the decree</hi> (as a woman with child,<note place="margin">Zeph. 2.2.</note> or woman rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to trauell) <hi>bring forth:</hi> and what will it bring forth, but a day of anger and great deſtruction from God, which is the ſeale of his writing? Therefore before this writing be ſealed, and <hi>the decree bring forth;</hi> do ye driue out the cauſe of the Lords wrath, (ſaith he) that his wrath do not driue you to deſtruction, when it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth as a tempeſt againſt ſinners.

For what contempt is there euery where of God &amp; his holy word? in his ſeruice what diſorder and negligence? his bleſſed name how fearefully and commonly is it blaſphemed in all tongues and mouthes? how are his Sabbaths violated? and how is Gods day made the diuels day by an vniuerſall prophaneneſſe? how is the land filled with outrages and ſtrange ſlaughters? what ſhedding of bloud openly by frayes and quarrels, cloſely by extortion, and cunningly by poyſons? Inceſt, adulterie, fornication with their In-mates, go through the land: and when was there greater, or like exceſſe in apparell and building as now? How much of the patrimonie of the land goeth away in ſmoke and fumes? and how much do theſe ſmoke-mongers conſume daily in that which doth them no good but great hurt? theſes are common: ſo are rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beries, oppreſſion, and the ſpoyle of the poore: lying is become a ſcience and art of great gaine; and for falſe witneſſe in iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ſtrengthened with periurie and bold ſwearing; what is it but an office of friendſhip and filthie hire? Theſe and the like ſins are the ſinnes of our age and nation: we keepe them in our bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome, and hide them vnder our tongue: and how can we thinke to be ſpared in ſuch conſciences and delight of ſinning? how can it be but that as one cloud followeth another till the Sunne con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume them: ſo iudgement ſhould be after iudgement, till we be conſumed, either by the comming of the laſt day, of by an end of Englands beſt dayes, except repentance, that Sunne of our skie,

So, how can we thinke to auoyde any <hi>Plague,</hi> foſtering the plague of ſinne? or hope turning againſt God (which wee do by impeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tencie) to haue credit with him? Therefore (as I ſaid) in theſe manners, and in this ſtate of ſinne, we prepare our ſelues and are readie for any deſtruction that God ſhall ſend, not to auoide it (not auoyding the cauſe) but to periſh in it, whether <hi>Peſtilence, ſword, famine,</hi> or other death.</p>
               <p>But muſt wee (if wee will preuent the <hi>Plagues</hi> that are ſent) <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Vſe </seg>2</label> auoyde the cauſe for which they come? the cauſe is ſinne, or the euill cuſtome of ſinne much deſired and followed by vngodly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons: then we muſt abhorre and forgo by ſpeedie repentance all ſuch death-threatning cuſtomes and courſes of life, that make careleſſe ſinners naked, that is, open to all the ſtrokes of God, <hi>Exod.</hi> 32.25. we muſt ſtrangle our ſinnes, if we would not bee ſtrangled in them by Gods iudgements, hauing ſtained our veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels, we muſt cleanſe them by repentance: and fauour nothing that may bring vs out of fauour with God. And ſpecially let vs thinke of this when any iudgement begins. For, <hi>if we put iniquitie out of our hand, and let no wickedneſſe dwell in our tabernacle: we ſhall lift vp our faces without ſpot,</hi> to wit, of ſhame; <hi>we ſhall be ſtedfaſt, and ſhall not feare, Iob</hi> 11.14.15. <hi>and</hi> 22.23. The wicked thinke of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing this way, either when a <hi>Plague</hi> is begunne, or hath long wrought: but as a man ouercome with his wine, careth not in what dangers <hi>he lieth downe, Prou.</hi> 23.34. nor where he makes his pillow; ſo they are indifferent (ſo ſtrongly doth the wine of ſinne worke in their heads and whole man) whether they be in a ſtorme or calme: whether God be with them or againſt them: whether it be peace or deſtruction that comes from the Almightie. But, ſuch in ſtead of preparing for God, prepare for the curſe of God, to which they make haſte; and in ſtead of reuerſing euils, bring them.</p>
               <p>Here we (further) ſee, that ſin is the onely cauſe, as of the <hi>Plague,</hi>

God drowned the old world in a <hi>ſea of waters,</hi> but firſt they were drowned <hi>in a ſea of ſinne: Gen.</hi> 7.11.12.21. and <hi>Sodome,</hi> burning in luſt, was burnt with fire; <hi>Gen.</hi> 19.24, 25. There is a Cup in Gods hand mixed with red wine, and they drinke of it, who haue made vp their meaſure with their ſcarlet, or red ſins: yea the dregges of it are powred out, but alwaies vpon thoſe that are frozen in their dregges, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 75.8. <hi>Zeph.</hi> 1.12. If God ſend a waſting <hi>Peſtilence</hi> vpon a Land, it is becauſe that Land hath ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned againſt him: and ſin is (though not the naturall yet) the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoking cauſe thereof: ſo the Scriptures teach, <hi>Exod.</hi> 5.3. <hi>Ier.</hi> 29.18. 1. <hi>Chron.</hi> 21.1.14. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 106.28. <hi>Deut.</hi> 28.28. <hi>Ezech.</hi> 16.46.47. 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.30. <hi>Leuit.</hi> 26.14.15. If (therefore we ſerue God cold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, or not at all: if wee bee rebellious to him and his Miniſters: if we truſt to creatures in the ſtreights of troubles: if we ſerue God ſuperſtitiouſly after our owne waies, not after his word: if young and old in our ſtreetes horribly ſweare, and blaſpheme: if our ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of bread cauſe pride and contempt: if we eate in the leauen of bitterneſſe, and drinke the wine of violence and wrong, at the Lords Table: and (laſtly) if our Magiſtrates reuenge for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues with the ſharpe edge of their authority, and not for Gods diſhonor, and the contempts of his truth; how can it be but God muſt needs breake in by <hi>Peſtilence,</hi> or ſome other way, and lay out ſinnes vpon vs? I ſay ſome other way: for, he doth not viſit (al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way) after one manner, and with one kinde of iudgement; but diuerſly, and with ſundrie ſorts of <hi>Plagues.</hi> When (therefore) God beginneth his iudgements among vs, let vs impute them to the right father, the vncorrected and raging wickedneſſe of the land; and not to a wrong cauſe, as moſt doe. Some, when a contagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous diſeaſe is ſent, are carefull to purge the body, which is not to be omitted; but haue no care to reforme the ſoule, which ſhould be firſt done: for the cauſe of all infirmities is in it. If God ſend troubles, they take them away by policie, but not the cauſe of them by repentance: and, when God ſcourgeth a nation, they looke at the rod, but little regard the ſtriker. So much for the promiſe made to the godly mans <hi>Perſon;</hi> that which is made to

Now the Prophet ſheweth that not onely his owne <hi>Perſon</hi> ſhall be ſafe, but his <hi>dwelling</hi> alſo, or dwellers with him, for his ſake: for, the houſe is taken here, by a figure, for thoſe that are in it: and ſo his meaning is: when God ſhall viſit for ſinne, with any of his ſore <hi>Plagues;</hi> both the righteous man, and the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous mans familie, and houſhould ſhall be ſafe and ſound. The Doctrine is manifeſt in the Text; which is,</p>
               <p>That a good mans familie ſhall bee ſafe for that good mans <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Doct. </seg>1</label> ſake: and (more generally) it teacheth, that the wicked fare bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for the godly that dwell among them: and that God (often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times) ſpares a houſe for his ſeruants ſake that is in it.

For, what is this, but a more ſignificant and ſpeciall declaration of Gods fauors to the <hi>righteous?</hi> which may be conſidered in the perſons by whoſe <hi>miniſterie</hi> they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaue ſuch fauours, the <hi>Angels:</hi> and the perils from which they
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:4442:45"/>are kept, in the hand of thoſe <hi>Angels.</hi> For the <hi>Angels,</hi> it is firſt to be noted, that what they do herein, they do it by a charge or cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, <hi>verſe</hi> 11. and then in what manner they do it, <hi>verſe</hi> 12. For their calling vnto this ſeruice in the Churches ſafetie, it is expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in this word <hi>He,</hi> by which is meant God, the giuer of the <hi>charge, and Lord of them.</hi> And this charge is giuen to the <hi>Angels</hi> ouer one perſon, and not to one <hi>Angell</hi> onely to bee ouer him, according to the bold fancie of the Church of Rome: the godly are compared to <hi>infants,</hi> the Angels to <hi>Nurſes,</hi> the impediments in their way to heauen, to <hi>a ſtone of offence.</hi> But to returne to the perſons here charged, the <hi>Angels,</hi> the word <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel</hi> is a name, not of their ſubſtance, but of their office; which is, that they <hi>are ſent forth,</hi> or ſent <hi>à latere,</hi> from God to men. So it is ſaid in the Pſalme: <hi>He maketh his ſpirits, Angels,</hi> or <hi>Meſſengers, Pſal.</hi> 104.4. their ſubſtance is to be <hi>ſpirits of an inuiſible nature and being:</hi> but <hi>to ſtand in the preſence of God day and night,</hi> that is, conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually, <hi>waiting to go forth with his commiſſion,</hi> when <hi>he will ſend them,</hi> is the office and holy effect of their <hi>nature and being:</hi> and ſo, not of their ſubſtance, but of their office and miniſterie. Now where the Prophet ſaith <hi>He,</hi> that is, <hi>God ſhall giue his Angels charge, &amp;c.</hi> his meaning is, that they are called of God to this ſeruice, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed by him, before they (thus) miniſter: or, he calleth and they ſerue, and giueth the charge and they obey it.</p>

Chriſt himſelfe had his Commiſſion ſealed to him by him that ſent him, before hee would publiſh the decree, which was, that the Lord had ſaid vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him: <hi>Thou art my Sonne, this day haue I begotten thee, Hebr.</hi> 5.5. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 2.7. <hi>Moſes</hi> was vnwilling and drew backe when God cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led him to the office of a deliuerer, <hi>Exod.</hi> 4.1.2.3.10.11.13. yea, refuſed and put off till God was angrie, <hi>

                  <hi>To keepe thee in all thy waies: they ſhall beare thee vp, &amp;c.</hi>
               </q>
               <p>THe manner of preſeruing the Righteous, muſt be by a kind of watch or keeping; and by a nurſing of them vp with the hand, or a bearing of them in their hands. In the firſt, it is ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed vpon what condition, they ſhall bee ſo watched and kept;
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:4442:46"/>namely, ſo long as they keepe themſelues within the bounds of their calling, and depart not from the wayes that God hath ſet them to walke in. And in the ſecond, it is ſaid (but in a figuratiue ſpeech) that <hi>they ſhall beare them in their hands;</hi> or, hold them faſt, as Nurſes doe their little ones. For, the Angels are not bodies, neither haue hands. And the Prophets meaning is; that the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels of God as Nurſes, hold the Faithfull in their hands, as chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and ſaue them as little ones from falling. The kind of ſpeech is taken from nurſing Mothers, or Nurſes, who hold their young children ſo faſt in their hands, or ſafe in their armes, that they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not fall. It may (alſo) be taken from perſons, who haue things of worth in their hands; and therefore will not neglect them, but carefully look vnto them. The ſumme of all is: The Faithfull are by Gods appointment, kept, as with a watch, in their waies; and guarded with troops of Angels, that haue not onely a generall care, but a particular for them.</p>
               <p>The Doctrine from hence is: the godly cannot but be ſurely <label type="milestone">

<pb n="96" facs="tcp:4442:52"/>God oftentimes giueth them none, or taketh thoſe they haue: and they that are blowne vp with vaine praiſes, many times, meete with a ſtorme of ſlander vpon their names to humble them. Sometimes, God trieth vs by afflictions, how much wee will ſuffer for him, and how patiently when he dealeth in ſuch rough manner with vs: oftentimes, hee ſetteth vs vp as his marke, to ſhoote at; that the arrowes of his quiuer may pierce into vs, to proue what is in vs: and as <hi>Peter</hi> was bound in priſon with two chaines, and ſhut vp as faſt with a ſtrong watch, and iron gate as malice could deuiſe for the ſafe keeping of him, till he ſhould be brought out to the people, the next day, <hi>Acts</hi> 12 5. which was not in any diſpleaſure to <hi>Peter</hi> on Gods part, but to make his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuerance more glorious, <hi>verſe</hi> 18, 19. ſo the Lord may, and doth (ſometimes) ſhut vp by <hi>Peſtilence,</hi> and a perſecuted life, as with chaines in priſon, his deareſt <hi>Peters,</hi> and with troubles keepe them in, as with an iron gate; not becauſe he loues them not, but that he may ſhew his greater power, either by deliuering them into the libertie of this life, or of the Saints, in the life to come. Beſides, S. <hi>Peter</hi> ſpeaketh of a fierie tryall, or iudgement that beginneth at Gods owne houſe; not to conſume it like droſſe, but to purge it like gold, not to deſtroy it, but to build it with more glory and excellency, 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 4.12, 17.</p>

                  <hi>DAuid</hi> (in this ſecond ſpeciall propoſition of Gods deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance by the Angels) ſpeaketh of a further benefit, by them, to the righteous, then he had ſpoken of: before he ſaid, that they keepe them from harmes: Heere he faith, that they doe not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly keepe them from harmes, but make them able to ſoyle all thoſe that would harme them; be it the Lion of the wilderneſſe, or the roaring Lion of hell, be it Man or Beaſt. And this hee ſpeaketh by his owne experience, who, by diuine aſſiſtance, ſlew firſt a Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and then a Beare, 1. <hi>Sam.</hi> 17.36. neither preuailed onely a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt theſe, but ſubdued, in battell, all his ſtrong enemies: and vanquiſhed all powers againſt him, on earth, and in hell. Hauing this experience himſelfe, he aſſureth all that walke in the way of the good Angels by a good and wel-ordered life, that they ſhall walke in no dangerous wayes, but (euery ſtep) in the protection of God, and ſo, as no creature (though otherwiſe, cruell and ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemous) ſhall bee ſo to them, but gentle and without offence: Or, if they will needs thruſt forth their venome, and (in their fierce kinde, ſet vpon them, they ſhall be ſubdued to them by the Angels, that keepe them. And this, (ſpeaking of the Lion, the Adder, the yong Lion, and the Dragon) hee ſetteth downe in a phraſe of ſuperiotitie, ſaying; They ſhall tread vpon them, or inſult ouer them as conquerors. Some Writers reſtraine theſe words (co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>paratiuely) to the <hi>Plague</hi> of <hi>Peſtilence;</hi> meaning that the godly ſhall preuaile againſt it, though (in the nature of it) it deuoure like a Lion, and bite deadly, as an Aſpe or Adder: yea though it bee fierce, and rage fiercely like a young Lion, and kill by a kind of tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring as Dragons doe. But I take the Prophets drift to bee here, in an hyperbole or ſuperlatiue ſpeech, to ſhew, that the righteous are not onely ſecured from all harmes which may come by the <hi>Peſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence</hi> whereof this <hi>Pſalme</hi> doth ſpecially intreat) or any other cuil, be it open (meant by the Lion, and yong Lion;) or ſecret reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled by the Dragon and Aſpe:) but that they ſhall tread downe to confuſion by the Angels, that is, by their miniſteries, euery power and enmitie that is againſt them, whether of Satan, or Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans members. None of them ſhal hurt or deſtroy in all the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine

               <p>The Doctrine from hence is: <label type="milestone">

                  </label> All hurtfull things and creatures are by God in the hand of his Angels, made ſubiect to the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, and put vnder their feet, be they Men, wilde Beaſts or diuels. Chriſt hath broken the head of Satan, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.15. that is, hath quite deſtroied his power, and ſpoiled him in that part where his life was. And now he is but as a vanquiſhed enemy to all true Chriſtians, who in their head, haue and ſhall daily trample him vnder feet, <hi>Rom.</hi> 16.20. A young Lion roared at <hi>Sampſon, and he rent him as one would haue rent a Kidde, hauing nothing in his hand, ludg.</hi> 14.6.

This was prophecied of by <hi>Hoſea, Hoſ.</hi> 2.18. and promiſed by Chriſt. <hi>Marc.</hi> 16.17, 18. and <hi>Ezechiel</hi> ſpeaking of the prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the godly from wild beaſts, ſayth: <hi>they ſhall dwell ſafely in the wilderneſſe, and ſleepe in the woods,</hi> Eze. 34.25. that is, when others are toſſed, as vpon an vnquiet Sea, <hi>their Soule ſhall dwell at eaſe,</hi> Pſal. 25.13. And <hi>Daniel</hi> was without hurt among the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; when they that loued not God, and hated him, had not one bone whole, nor member vn-torne, after the Lions once had caught them, <hi>Dan.</hi> 6.22, 23, 24. How did <hi>Eliſha,</hi> being but one weake and vnarmed Man, lead a whole weapned-band of <hi>Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mites,</hi> blinde to <hi>Samaria?</hi> 2. <hi>King.</hi> 6.18, 19.

               <p>Secondly, all the creatures before the fall (all ſaue the good Angels) were vnder the dominion of man, and became hurtfull by ſinne. But the ſinnes of the Faithfull are all pardoned in mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie

Then, he is adopted by God, and becommeth the heire and lawfull Lord of all the creatures. For his renuing of the couenant with vs, is a renuing of the Couenant betweene the creatures and vs: and when they are in couenant with vs, what hurt can they doe vs? and when wee are in couenant with God, what ſeruice can they deny vs?</p>

All the creatures are our enemies, ready (when God will giue them leaue) to reuenge his diſhonour vpon vs; the fire by burning, the water by drowning, the earth by burying vs aliue, as it did thoſe wicked men who gathered themſelues toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther at the dore of the Tabernacle againſt <hi>Moſes,</hi> and againſt <hi>Aaron</hi> whom God ſent, <hi>Num.</hi> 16.3.22. If warre be threatned, though it be a good thing to prepare our men; yet it is a better thing, and more ſafe (firſt) to prepare for peace, by our peace with God. For, then, either we ſhall haue peace, or a proſperous war; either no enemies, or none to hurt vs: and they that riſe vp a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt vs ſhall fall downe before vs. If wee would auoide the ſpoiles and loſſes that may come by fire or water, by hurtfull ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents, and vnſeaſonable yeares, by ouer-much raine, or by want thereof; we muſt deale faithfully with their Lord and ours, ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to him, and they will take vp with vs, ſerue him and they will not hurt vs. If wee would tread downe that roaring Lion that goeth about, ſeeking whom hee may deuoure, 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 5.8. or, walke vpon him and go ouer him, as men doe ouer the graues of the dead; wee muſt, by the new man in Chriſt, get our part, as in his temptations, ſo in his ouer-commings; or, we muſt be follo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wers
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:4442:54"/>of Chriſt in his patience, if wee will be followers of him to his victories, and vanquiſh the diuell. Hee that will raigne with Chriſt muſt liue like a Chriſtian, and warre as he did, that meanes to triumph as he doth. Further, wouldſt thou haue dominion c<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer the creatures, ſpecially ouer thoſe that may do hurt? Labour to riſe by ſound repentance, from that firſt fall, by which they haue gotten aboue thee, and hold thee vnder, ſo they that now ſubdue thee, ſhall be ſubdued vnto thee.</p>
               <p>This is the Priuiledge of the Faithfull, a priuiledge proper to true Chriſtians, though encloſed from them by ſome Popes, to whom it no way belongeth: and namely, by <hi>Alexander</hi> the <hi>third of that name,</hi> who treading on the Emperour his Maſter,<note place="margin">

               <p>A reproofe of thoſe Chriſtians, who feare too much, as ſome <label type="milestone">

A Chriſtian muſt ſtriue, by the Scriptures, againſt all carnall feares and diſtruſts, and not giue way to them, by cowardly yeeldings. But ſome know nothing in the Word: Such muſt endeuour to learne, or, looke to be confounded in the cuill day: and ſome, if they cannot preſently ſee the drift of their affliction in a trifle, take on as if a Lion were without, <hi>Prou.</hi> 22.13. and they ſhould dye no other death.</p>
               <p>But, muſt we walke vpon a Lyon; and may we feare our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction by a Mouſe? Muſt we trample vpon a Dragon, and ſhall we feare a ſimple flie?

At one time they haue thought themſelues verie ſtrong in God, and at another, ſo weake and ſo caſt downe, that they could not poſſibly riſe; but in all this they had a ſmacke of Man in them, and their fleſh was weake: yet their ſpirit was ready; and waited on God, not making haſte, but poſſeſſing their ſoules till hee deliuered them. It is not ſo with theſe vnſetled Daſtards, and run-awayes, who are ready to caſt off all: if Satan nibble but a little at their heele, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.15. If the Goſpel of the Croſſe begin to lay ſome reſtraint vpon them, they will be zealous no longer: and when a great man looks ſtrange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly or awry vpon them, for their good wayes, it is as if a Lyon met them; therefore they preſently turne out of thoſe wayes to walke in a way that ſhall leſſe offend. Theſe are the fearfull and vnbeleeuers that this Scripture cenſures; who for euery little wrinch or foile, goe lame of all courage in good things; where the godly reſiſt vnto blood, neuer forſaking their weapons, till death driue them out of the field, imperious death that cannot be reſiſted.</p>

               <p>The duties of the faithfull, are in affection, or effect: duties of affection are the loue of God, and knowledge of his name: the dutie of effect is prayer: the promiſes annexed are; deliuerance in trouble; deſence and ſafety; the hearing of their prayers; Gods being with them in their troubles; honours, life, long life, and daies of ſaluation: for the duties of the faithfull, the firſt of them is loue: for, the Lord, being ſpeaker, ſaith:</p>

               <p>BY loue (here) is meant the loue that cauſeth a ſtrong depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance on God: a mighty vehement, firme, and feruent loue: or, ſuch loue as is betweene young-married couples, <hi>Gen.</hi> 34.8. <hi>Deut.</hi> 21.11. they deſire to be much together, and much to talke together: in abſence, one to heare from another, and one to ſend to another.

This is the affection that the faithfull doe ſet vpon God.</p>

<pb n="107" facs="tcp:4442:57"/>before me, who required this of your hands?</hi> Eſa. 1.12. It was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they loued outwardly, not in heart; or in a manner, not thorowly, and ſeemingly, not ſo indeed. For, God neuer liked a full hand and an empty heart. And therefore when he taught his people by <hi>Moſes,</hi> how they ſhould loue him, and not looſe the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour of their loue, he willed them to <hi>loue him with all their heart, with all their ſoule, and with all their might,</hi> Deut. 6, 5. that is, to loue him with all their powers, and with all they could doe.</p>
               <p>This was repeated (afterward) by <hi>Ioſua,</hi> who ſucceeded <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> in the throne: where hee biddeth the people to <hi>take diligent heed,</hi> that they loue no otherwiſe then by <hi>cleauing to God,</hi> and <hi>ſeruing him with all their heart, and with all their ſoule,</hi> Ioſ. 22.5. It is the ſame in effect that <hi>Moſes</hi> had ſaid before him, and hath the ſame meaning; which is, that God is not bound with euerie affection, but with the cord of that, which is drawne from the ſeruice and entireneſſe of a heart that wholly and chiefly is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected to him. This the Prophet <hi>Micah</hi> calleth <hi>a walking with God, Micah</hi> 6.8. when wee ſo loue him that we goe no farther then he doth; and yet goe as farre. And ſo did <hi>Enoch;</hi> who (therefore) was ſaid to haue pleaſed God, that is, by faith and true repentance to haue pleaſed him, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.5. for, can two walke, together vnleſſe they be agreed, <hi>Amos.</hi> 3.3. Now, hee that ſo pleaſeth God; doth (doubleſſe) loue him with all his heart: and ſuch a louer was <hi>Enoch:</hi> when an expounder of the Law asked Chriſt, which was the great Commandement in the Law; he ſaid to him: <hi>thou ſhalt loue the Lord thy God, with all thy heart, with all thy ſoule, and with all thy minde, Mat.</hi> 22.37. what <hi>Moſes</hi> (the ſhadow) had ſpoken, the ſame ſpake Chriſt, the<note n="b" place="margin">Iohn 1.9.</note> light; that thus, vnder two witneſſes it might ſtand ſure, that God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth in his ſeruice, not ſeeming, but heart-whole Louers.

The ſpeech is taken from the manner of fortifying, vſed in wars: where, for more ſecuritie, towers of defence were ſet on high rockes and hilles. Such fortreſſes, or mounted-houſes of ſafety will God prouide and eſtabliſh for thoſe that know, that is, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe his name; when enemies vexe them, or plagues threaten them, or troubles draw neare vnto them.

And, to know here, is not barely to know, but to know with faith: nor, is it bare knowledge, but acknowledgement: when, knowing the power of God ouer vs, and care for vs, we confeſſe and beleeue the ſame, with a reſting thereupon, in all our troubles? Before, we heard of beleeuing in God: the Prophet here, or the Lord by him, ſpeaketh of knowing, becauſe none can rightly put confidence in God that doth not know him: as <hi>Pſal.</hi> 9.10. for, why doe men ſo much and vſually, truſt their rich friends, but becauſe they know they can helpe them, and are perſwaded they will? and why ſerue they great men rather then poore men, but becauſe, in like manner they know that great men can preferre them, where poore men cannot? ſo, they that know what a rich rewarder God is of the leaſt things done to him in his ſeruice and worſhip, and how able ſo to doe, cannot but loue and ſerue him.</p>

Hee addeth; and ſerue him with a perfect heart; that is, vprightly, and as hee will be worſhipped, which none can doe that knoweth not the lawes and manner of his ſeruice: and ſo, ſound and ſanctified knowledge is the mother of chriſtian deuotion; not Popiſh ignorance. Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine wicked worldlings are reprooued in the booke of <hi>Iob,</hi> as contemners of God, the reaſon is; they deſired not, or they ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red not for the knowledge of his wayes, <hi>Iob.</hi> 21.14. and how could they (then) but be irreligious in heart, and impious in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauiour? for, not knowing Gods power, what ſhould containe them? and ignorant of his kindneſſe, what could allure them to be other, or to doe otherwiſe? Did that land loue God, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in <hi>by ſwearing, and lying, and killing, and ſtealing, and whoring they brake out, and blood touched blood?</hi> It is out of queſtion it did not, and why did it not? the Prophet tels vs: <hi>there was no knowledge of God in that land,</hi> Hoſ 4.1, 2.

And, if the minde be not good; what can be good; it being certaine, that what the minde is, that the man is?

But this muſt not bee euery kinde of prayer, as appeareth by the ioyning together the ſenten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, but that prayer, or ſtrong cry of the heart in prayer, that is ioyned with knowledge, and ſtandeth in loue: that is, he that will pray with hope, muſt both know the Lord, confeſſing his good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe; and loue him with relying on his truth.

So now, the blind ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of ignorant prayers, and the lame of praying weakely, and without the affection of confidence in God, are no reaſonable ſeruice of him? Gods children ſpeake with vehemency, ſaying,
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:4442:64"/>Abba Father, or twice father; and not ſoftly, as afraid, but loude with aſſurance; for they cry, Abba Father, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.15. knowing that what God hath pledged to them by his promiſe, he will not violate. Alſo, they pray with vnderſtanding: knowing that all that pray not with knowledge, pray with loſſe For, they cannot watch the ſucceſſe of their prayers, nor tell how they ſpeed, not knowing what they prayed for And without this experience who can bee thankefull? and without thankefulneſſe, what can the hope be, but loſſe?

               <p>The Doctrine (therefore) that ariſeth from this context is; they <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Doct. </seg>1</label> that will pray aright, and with good aſſurance, muſt know God, and loue him. But I paſſe it, as not being in the Text, and becauſe inough hath been ſpoken of it already. That which theſe words directly aime at is; that they they that will be deliuered muſt vſe prayer the meane of deliuerance. And this Prayer is a calling vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on God, to wit in Chriſt: darkely then, plainely now: then to come, now come and glorified: which is ſeene in foure things; as ſupplications, prayers, interceſſions, and giuing of thankes. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.1. By ſupplication is meant that kinde of prayer, or thing in prayer, whereby we craue the turning away of euill things from vs. Prayer, or obſecration is, that wherein wee deſire all good things neceſſarie for vs. Interceſſion, that, by which wee pray lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uingly for our friends, and charitably for our enemies: and gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing of thankes that, which vpon the receit of a fauour, goeth, with praiſe in our prayers, to him that gaue it. Now, he that wil ſee the ſaluation of God, muſt do all this. In all theſe, he muſt talke with God as did <hi>M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ſes:</hi> and hee may talke with him, as with a friend bringing good affections to the words of his prayer. In the 50. Pſalme, and 15. <hi>verſe</hi> God promiſed deliuerance to his children in the day of their trouble: but with the condition of Prayer, as here; <hi>Call vpon me;</hi> as if he had ſaid; if ye will haue my helpe, or, if ye will haue me to helpe you, pray. So, Chriſt our Sauiour, promiſing eaſe, that is, deliuerance, to all, who, for his ſake, are laden with troubles, and labour of wrongs; bids them to
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:4442:65"/>come to him, as if hee had bidden them to call vpon him, if they will be caſed, <hi>Math.</hi> 11.28. And the Lord will be found, but it is of thoſe that ſeeke him with prayer, <hi>Math.</hi> 7.7. <hi>Iehoſhaphat</hi> ſo ſought him, and found his helpe againſt the children of <hi>Ammon,</hi> and <hi>Moab,</hi> and Mount Seir, 2. <hi>Chron.</hi> 20.10.22, 23, 24. And, <hi>Salomon,</hi> in the Dedication of the Temple, deſireth God to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline to his people in their diſtreſſe; that is, when in perill and terrour, they confeſſe their ſinnes, and make their ſupplicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to him, his prayer is that hee would deliuer them: but it is with condition, as before, 1. <hi>King.</hi> 10.31.33.35, 38, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> For, there is no ſuch meanes of acceſſe to God as prayer; neither doth he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, out of the heauen, to any thing that we preferre to him, ſo directly, as to prayer, and he delighteth in the ſoule of his ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice more then in all burnt-offerings. If the great waters burſt in, it is prayer that muſt caſt vp a bank of ſtop vnto them, <hi>Pſa.</hi> 32.6. Many times God deliuereth without prayer; (which ſhould make vs more thankefull, but not leſſe diligent to vſe the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe hereafter) but prayer is Gods owne ordinance, that bindeth him to deliuer vs. By it, he giueth vs his earneſt, or ſomewhat in hand to confirme vnto vs the light of his ſaluation in this mid-vale of darkneſſe. By it wee haue a ſanctified right to the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.5. By it we receiue the key that opens Gods trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, and puls downe his mercies vpon vs. <hi>Math.</hi> 7.7. By it we come into the Preſence, and haue ſpeech with him that is greater then all Princes, <hi>Gen.</hi> 18.22, 23, 24, &amp;c. By it, if God bee ready to ſtrike, wee hold him backe, as it were, that he cannot exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute his iudgements, <hi>Exod.</hi> 32.10. and by it, we confeſſe that we receiue and ſeeke all good things at Gods hands, running to him in our wants, and reioycing in him for our welfare. If (then) wee looke to be deliuered in trouble: in trouble, wee muſt pray to the Lord our deliuerer. The reaſons.</p>

               <p>Secondly, it is of the Commandement and Ordinance of God
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:4442:65"/>that we ſhould pray, that is, call on him in our troubles, <hi>Mat.</hi> 6.9.

               <p>Thirdly, prayer is a part of his ſeruice, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 50.23. and the <label type="milestone">

Now, is prayer a part of his ſeruice, and ſhall wee refuſe in our troubles to ſerue him? that is, in them, to pray vnto him, and to call vpon his Name? And as it is a part of his ſeruice; ſo it is a meane of our ſaluation, <hi>Ioel</hi> 2.32. I ſay then: deſire we to be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued? or if we long not to be damned, let vs pray.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, a benefit is worth the asking, and we make ſuite to <label type="milestone">

               <p>An admonition (therefore) to be frequent in this duty which <label type="milestone">

In a danger (otherwiſe incurable) and when worldly wiſe men know not what to doe, and when all
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:4442:66"/>their cunning is gone: the godly (that giue themſelues to prayer,) know both what to doe, and where to finde ſuccour: for, they continue calling vpon God, till thoſe raging and vntamed floods of trouble be gone, and God ſend deliuerance from his holy ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitation in heauen.</p>

They cannot ſay with the three children of God in the fierie ouen; <hi>Our God whom we ſerue, will deliuer vs,</hi> Dan. 3.17. but the God whom wee neuer ſerued; and therefore cannot in iuſtice deliuer vs, but ſuffer vs rather to periſh in that flame, that burneth vp the vngodly, as droſſe. And ſince a confeſſion that there is a God ſtandeth not without a prayer of confeſsion due vnto him: they denying the one, how can they but be deniers of the other? And denying God, how can they with comfort looke for the ſaluation of God? Let them conſider this, who neither at home, nor in the aſſembly, once a weeke, call vpon God: or if their lips goe, their heart is not in the buſineſſe of prayer. Some cannot pray, but in the Church: and ſome will not pray when they are at Church: what difference betweene ſuch, and deniers of God?

And now, that the bloodie <hi>Eſau:</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> prepare with ſuch crueltie, and numbers to deuoure poore <hi>Iacob:</hi> what can theſe doe, but ſtrengthen them, &amp; weaken the righteous as they do by horrible Atheiſme?

Let God threaten our harueſt and corne fields with ill weather and forcible tempeſts; what good doe theſe, wanting the key where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with <hi>Elijah</hi> ſhut the heauen, and opening it wider and further by their blaſphemies?

               <p>But (further) the Lord (ſpeaking of the righteous) ſaith; <hi>Hee ſhall call vpon me,</hi> that is, hee ſhall goe to no other for helpe in trouble. Which was the practiſe of the Fathers in the old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <label type="milestone">

               <p>For our approach to any other, then to him that is God, there is not either in the old or new Teſtament any commandement, or practice: and the prayer taught by Chriſt, (the moſt perfect and beſt that euer was taught) doth proue as much.</p>

               <p>BEfore, we heard of deliuerance: but (here) it is promiſed, in a ſtrange manner, to the righteous: and that is; that God will (as it were) put himſelfe into their troubles, to make himſelfe a partie in them: and (ſo) bee their deliuerer: for, by his being with them, is not meant (onely) his being ſo by an infinite Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, and generall prouidence; (for ſo hee filleth all things, and is with all his creatures;) but his being with them in a more ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall manner, and more particularly, by his Spirit of promiſe and comfort in their troubles: it being certaine, that the ſoules of the righteous ſometimes eat, and drinke, and feaſt with Chriſt; and at other times crie much, and aske many watchmen for him, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they can finde him, <hi>Cant.</hi> 5.5, 6, 7, 8.

                  </label> that the godly haue the Lord (al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies) a preſent deliuerer in great troubles. They ſhall wade through many afflictions: but, when they begin to ſinke, his hand is ready to ſaue them, <hi>Mat.</hi> 14.30.31. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 89.19. Hee is alwayes preſent with his Church, but more familiarly, in great troubles: as a good father is alwayes affected to his childe; but more tenderly, in ſome grieuous ſickeneſſe. And as a King doth ſhew a more louing countenance to his houſhold ſeruants at one time then at another; (ſometimes) frowning, and (ſometimes) ſmiling vpon them: ſo the King of all the kingdomes of the earth, doth not (euer) alike graciouſly ſhew himſelfe to his dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt people, (though he be neuer from them, more then the King from Court;) but ſometimes in the ſmiles of his mercy and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, frowningly in diſpleaſure, hee lookes vpon them. Yet, howſoeuer mortall Princes may change their fauours; God will neuer leaue his children. The Prophet <hi>Dauid</hi> ſet the Lord al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way before him; <hi>Pſal.</hi> 16.8. that is, committed his wayes in all matters to him, or made him Arbiter of his pathes: and his rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:4442:70"/>was; he was at his right hand, or his readie hand, who alway hedged him in with his power againſt preſent euils and dangers to come. When they that were humbled for their rebellion againſt the words of the Lord, cryed with faith to him in their affliction; they were inſtantly deliuered from their diſtreſſe, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 107.12, 13. God was within call, and ſo neare, that if they had, in that caſe, but ſighed to him, which is a leſſer matter then to cry; hee could not but haue heard, of whom the Prophet ſaith: <hi>My ſighing is not hid from thee,</hi> Pſal. 38.9. And when the three ſeruants of God were in the fierie furnace, God was with them in it to preſerue them; <hi>Dan.</hi> 3.25. and in the Kings heart to bring them foorth: for, the King ſpake and ſaid; <hi>Shadrach, Meſhak,</hi> and <hi>Abednego,</hi> the ſeruants of the high God, goe foorth, and come hither, <hi>Verſe</hi> 26.

               <p>Secondly, when ſuch are in trouble; he remembreth that they <label type="milestone">

               <p>Thirdly, the contrary would too much diſcomfort his people, <label type="milestone">

Many (whom I cannot call ill men) are vnreaſonably afraid, when God ſendeth the Plague of <hi>Peſtilence,</hi> or a plague of raine and waters: but who hath power in theſe Plagues? and who hath promiſed to the righteous, his comfortable preſence in them?

               <p>THis is the third promiſe, which is not (ſimply) of deliuerance, but of deliuerance with honour. And ſo, by an increaſe, more is promiſed, in theſe words, then before to the righteous: which is, that God will not onely deliuer them, but gloriouſly doe it, in their greateſt troubles; and, in an ouerplus of his fauour, (after) raiſe them to honour, as he did <hi>Ioſeph, Iob, Dauid, Daniel,</hi> and others. And therefore, where the Lord ſaith, <hi>I will honour him;</hi> it is as much as if he had ſaid, I will alway deliuer him, and ſometimes ſet him in the chaire of honour. This may well be the Lords meaning in this third thing promiſed to the righteous. For, all that are deliuered, are not ſo preferred: it is inough that ſome are, and it is certaine that they that are not; that is, that haue not theſe glories temporall, ſhall yet receiue (when they haue ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued their time) glory euerlaſting.

               <p>A Fourth promiſe made to the righteous is, that (when it ſhall be good for him) he ſhall be filled with dayes, and liue to old age: As <hi>Gedeon</hi> was buried in a good age, <hi>Iudg.</hi> 8.32. and <hi>Dauid</hi> dyed full of dayes, 1. <hi>Chro.</hi> 29.28. and <hi>Iob</hi> very old, after he had ſeene his ſonnes, and his ſonnes ſonnes for foure generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, <hi>Iob</hi> 42.16.17. It is like the Lord made this promiſe to the Faithfull, at what time the Angel cut downe ſo many in Iſrael, with the ſword of <hi>Peſtilence:</hi> for, the godly might (then) feare themſelues very much, that they alſo ſhould returne to their duſt in ſo great a mortalitie: but the Lord healeth that feare with his promiſe of a long life to thoſe that feare him, and, with faith, call vpon him: as if he had ſaid: ye ſhall not (onely) liue at this timer but (when old age ſhall be a bleſſing to you) liue long, and goe
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:4442:75"/>to your graues in a ripe and good age; your head being deckt with gray haires, and your heart filled with righteouſneſſe.</p>
               <p>This is ſpoken of the godly, ſuch as excell in goodneſſe: And therefore the doctrine is; <label type="milestone">

Beſides, ſuch promiſes are not abſolutly, but conditio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally made to the righteous; as if God ſee it fit, and if it be good for them, and neceſſary for the Church, that God prolong their dayes: otherwiſe, what is wanting in length of dayes, is made vp with the immortalitie of ioyfull dayes in heauen. And, though they liue but a ſhort time, yet haue they length of dayes in a ſort; euery day being a whole Summers day vnto them by the Sunne of Gods fauour, that ſhineth vpon their ſoules more and more, without any going downe. Thus it is prooued that long life, not abuſed, is a bleſſing of God, and may further appeare: The Reaſons.</p>

And to ſpare further labour in a matter wherein both the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaments are ſo plentifull, the very words of the doctrine, are the ſame Apoſtles owne words: <hi>The gift of God is eternall life through Ieſus Chriſt,</hi> Rom. 6.23. where hee ſheweth that ſaluation is a gift; and what is freer then gift? and giuen of God for Chriſt: that is, a gift whereof the authour is God, and the purchaſer Chriſt, the Sonne of God.

               <p>For, when <hi>Adam</hi> was once falne from Gods image in Paradiſe, and being driuen by guilty conſcience, had fledde to the weake ſuccour of leaues and buſhes for a hiding place againſt him, and the ſtorme of his iuſtice; the good Angels could not but abhorre vs; and the other creatures, how could they but become enemies to vs? and therefore no will in them to haue ſaued vs, if they could: onely, the fountaine of mercy, God the Father of Chriſt, and our Father in Chriſt, looked toward vs, and his eye (onely) pittied vs in this blood of our pollution, <hi>Ezech.</hi> 16.5.6. then he made his couenant of Saluation with vs in the ſeed of the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, by a perſon that ſhould come of woman; that bleſſed ſeed that ſhould breake the Serpents head, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.15.

For, God doth not giue his ſaluation to thoſe, who neither care to liue in obedience, nor prepare to die in faith. And,
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:4442:78"/>to loſe ſaluation, is to be in worſe caſe at our death then the beaſts that periſh.

For, hee hath millions of yeares (without end) to liue in flames of miſery, and torments of hell. <hi>His worme dieth not, and his fire neuer goeth out, Mar.</hi> 9.44.
